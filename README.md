# Applied-DevOps-project

We utilised CI/CD pipelines on Azure DevOps for two separate repositorites on Github (frontend and backend application), and created the YAML file. For this project, we used Applied DevOps practices such as CI/CD, release gates, deployment rings, slack, wiki, and Azure artifact. We also managed our project using the backlog in Azure DevOps and created work items, epics and features.
